# Grammar

Grammar reads grammar rules and generates random sentences.

Grammar
In this assignment you will complete a program that reads an input file with a grammar in Backus-Naur
Form and allows the user to randomly generate elements of the grammar. You will use recursion to
implement the core of your algorithm.

You are given a client program GrammarMain.java that does the file processing and user interaction. You
are to write a class called Grammar that manipulates a grammar. GrammarMain reads a BNF grammar
input text file and passes its entire contents to you as a list of strings. You must break each string from
the list into symbols and rules so that it can generate random elements of the grammar as output.
